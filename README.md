# Artificail Intelligence Project
In this game we try to implement the game step by step so that pac-man can improve eventually.

Phases of pac-man game will be described as below:
## Phase 1: 
The goal is reaching optimally to a position to find a food. The algorithms implemented in the phase:
* DFS (Depth First Algorithm)
* BFS (Breadth First Algorithm)
* ${A^*}$ Search Algorithm

## Phase 2:
In this phase there will be both of ghosts and pac-man as players. The algorithms implemented in the phase:
* Mini-Max Algorithm
* Alpha-Beta Pruning

## Phase 3:
In this phase we implement value interation and Q-learning. The algorithms implemented in the phase:
*  Asynchronous Value Iteration
*  Prioritized Sweeping Value Iteration
*  Approximate Q-learning

## Phase 4: 
The goal is designing sensors to locate and eat the ghosts.
