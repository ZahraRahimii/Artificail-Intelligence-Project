# Artificail Intelligence Project
In this game we try to implement the game step by step so that pac-man can improve eventually.

Phases of pac-man game will be described as below:
## Phase 1: 
The goals is reaching optimally to a position to find a food. The algorithms implemented in the phase:
* DFS (Depth First Algorithm)
* BFS (Breadth First Algorithm)
* $`{A^*}`$
